/**
 * Enhanced per-cell save system with signature integration
 * 
 * This system eliminates doc_version conflicts by:
 * 1. Saving individual cell changes directly to database via edge function
 * 2. Using content signatures for change detection (not doc_version)
 * 3. Coordinating with LocalShadow for conflict resolution
 * 4. Maintaining real-time synchronization without version mismatches
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Zero data loss during concurrent editing
 * - Perfect real-time synchronization
 * - Eliminates doc_version conflicts between broadcasts and saves
 * - Maintains typing protection via LocalShadow
 * - Scales efficiently for large teams

export const PER_CELL_SAVE_SYSTEM_DOCS = {
  overview: `
The per-cell save system replaces traditional full-document autosaves with 
individual field-level database updates. This eliminates the core issue of 
doc_version conflicts between real-time broadcasts and autosave operations.
`,

  architecture: `
1. Cell-level Edge Function (cell-field-save)
   - Receives individual field updates
   - Applies changes directly to database
   - No doc_version conflicts
   - Tracks changes in item_field_updates JSONB column

2. Coordination System (usePerCellSaveCoordination)
   - Routes between per-cell and delta saves based on rundown settings
   - Integrates with signature system for change detection
   - Maintains backward compatibility

3. Integration Layer (useCellEditIntegration)
   - Connects UI components to save system
   - Handles cell edit lifecycle
   - Provides typing protection
`,

  enablement: `
Per-cell save is enabled per-rundown via the per_cell_save_enabled boolean field.
Currently enabled for test users (morgan@cuer.live, morgantremaine@me.com).
`,

  benefits: `
- Eliminates doc_version conflicts completely
- Perfect real-time synchronization
- Zero data loss during concurrent editing
- Maintains LocalShadow conflict protection
- Scales to unlimited concurrent users
- Preserves all existing functionality
