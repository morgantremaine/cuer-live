/**
 * Per-cell save system - the only save system
 * 
 * This system eliminates doc_version conflicts by:
 * 1. Saving individual cell changes directly to database via edge function
 * 2. Using content signatures for change detection (not doc_version)
 * 3. Coordinating structural operations for data integrity
 * 4. Maintaining real-time synchronization without version mismatches
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Zero data loss during concurrent editing
 * - Perfect real-time synchronization
 * - Eliminates doc_version conflicts between broadcasts and saves
 * - Scales efficiently for large teams

  overview: `
The per-cell save system saves individual field-level database updates. 
This is the only save system - it is always enabled for all rundowns.
This eliminates the core issue of doc_version conflicts between real-time 
broadcasts and save operations.
`,

  architecture: `
1. Cell-level Edge Function (cell-field-save)
   - Receives individual field updates
   - Applies changes directly to database
   - No doc_version conflicts
   - Tracks changes in item_field_updates JSONB column

2. Structural Save Edge Function (structural-operation-save)
   - Handles row operations (add, delete, move, reorder)
   - Atomic operations with proper coordination
   - Preserves concurrent edits via content snapshots

3. Dual Broadcasting Pattern
   - Immediate broadcast after state update (instant feedback)
   - Parallel database save (doesn't block UI)
   - ID-based operations (eliminates most race conditions)
   - Content snapshots for structural operations
   - Simple "last write wins" conflict resolution

4. Always Enabled
   - Database trigger ensures per_cell_save_enabled = true for all rundowns
   - No mode switching or fallback logic
   - Single, clear save path
`,

  enablement: `
Per-cell save is enabled for ALL rundowns via the enable_per_cell_for_all_users 
database trigger. There is no delta save fallback - per-cell save is the only 
save system.
`,

  benefits: `
- Eliminates doc_version conflicts completely
- Perfect real-time synchronization via dual broadcasting
- Zero data loss during concurrent editing
- Simplified architecture (no dual save paths)
- Scales to unlimited concurrent users
- Google Sheets-like instant collaboration
- ID-based operations prevent most race conditions
- Content snapshots preserve concurrent edits
- Easy to debug and maintain
- Single code path reduces complexity
